            Castlepoint reads, registers and regulates all information in a network, in any format and any system. It uses Natural Language Processing to determine what each record is about, and so what regulations apply, and it then automates the process of compliance, disposition, security, privacy, audit, ediscovery, strategic, and operational management.
