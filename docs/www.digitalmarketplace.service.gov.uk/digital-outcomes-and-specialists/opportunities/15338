          Defence is a complex enterprise operating in all five domains. The cyber domain is becoming increasingly critical as operations in the ‘information age’ rely daily on connected capabilities to underpin strategic, operational, and tactical outputs.<br><br>Exponential growth in systems that rely on software components drives equivalent expansion of the need to maintain and update all components to safeguard against emerging vulnerabilities. The volume and pace at which vulnerabilities are exposed, exploited and weaponised is ever increasing. Remediation must also keep pace.<br><br>Defence faces the same challenges as the global IT industry, whilst also facing the threat of determined adversaries seeking disruptive effects across the five domains. All these threats are persistent in nature and global in scale due to the connected information age.<br><br>The critical nature of patching to maintain the health and security of systems means that there is a large marketplace available providing off the shelf patch management tools. The services available in the marketplace do not realise all MOD requirements within a single solution.  The MOD has commissioned the generation of a Modernising Patching Strategy to plan and direct the way in which Defence approaches the challenge of maintaining and updating its capabilities and systems.

          Defence capability operates in the traditional domains of Maritime, Land and Air. This drives complex physical constraints on the operation of digital capabilities. Digital technology in defence is integrated in nature, embedded in weapons systems, complex platforms and mission critical information systems. Defence capabilities do not follow an IT industry standard or pattern. Systems do not always have traditional network solutions, modern connection quality or physical security. Users demand far more than office-based working patterns or business availability targets. In IT terms, normal assumptions do not apply.
