HEE’s websites are how we communicate and engage with future and current health professionals, be they learners, educators, employers, partners, and the public at scale. The reach and focus of our websites extend simultaneously across local, regional, national and international audiences, and across specialisms, professions and multi-disciplinary areas of healthcare. <br><br>HEE is currently rationalising our existing web estate onto a new platform. Part of this involves consolidating our disparate web estate into discrete professional and multi-disciplinary hubs, and consider how these hubs might be unified around a single domain.<br><br>This opportunity has two objectives:<br>1) To understand the user and strategic needs for a new Nursing and Midwifery professional hub<br>2) To consider how these hubs might be unified around a single domain along with HEE&#39;s main corporate website.
