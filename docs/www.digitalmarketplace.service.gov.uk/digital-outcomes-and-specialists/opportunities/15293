The designs are being implemented in a new course comparison tool which we will need to further test/refine after it is released to live.

          The internal OfS Discover Uni team are the main contact points.  In addition, there may be a need for supporting liaison with key internal and external stakeholders. This might take the form of occasional short presentations of user testing/recommendations.

          The supplier can select the test platform to be used, which we would expect to be of current technology and accessibility standards.  This will also need to meet requirements and standards around participant consents and privacy standards, which should be borne in mind.

        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
          The site is built with an Azure serverless toolset using python (and html, javascript and sass). This includes the Azure search and API management, Azure Postgres SQL Server - CMS storage system to store content data and admin/moderators/editors credentials, and Highcharts - to build charts in wagtail CMS.  We recently set up the Site Improve tool on the website to monitor/ensure accessibility and to track/better understand user journeys. We will consider other systems/plug ins going forward.
