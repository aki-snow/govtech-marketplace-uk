          Disinformation is a multifaceted issue which requires a number of areas of cross-government expertise and, as a result, monitoring, analysis and policy functions are spread across a number of departments and agencies. Whilst DCMS provides coordination of these efforts, there exist several significant limitations to more effective use of data, with enhanced capability increasingly needed to produce a comprehensive picture of disinformation and to support our response to the growing threat that it poses. <br><br>DCMS has been successful in securing funding to deliver the Counter-Disinformation Data Platform project. The overarching objective of this pilot project is to improve HMG’s counter-disinformation capability: developing a more accurate, detailed and targeted understanding how harmful narratives are emerging and evolving over time, improving counter-disinformation data sharing across relevant government stakeholders, limiting duplication of effort and enabling effective interventions which reduce harm. We are looking for a multi-disciplinary supplier team to partner with to provide the necessary knowledge, skills and experience to lead a process of discovery, development and delivery for a prototype technological solution designed to address barriers and create a commonly understood information picture of disinformation.

          We are seeking a supplier team to help us to develop and deliver a digital solution designed to ingest and store anonymised social media data, to allow for large scale analysis of narrative trends to understand how these are evolving over time. This solution will identify key areas of risk and help HMG to address the evolving and sophisticated tactics used by malign actors, with an overall goal of mitigating the negative impacts of mis/disinformation and reducing harm. <br><br>The contracted project team will be involved across two phases of the project and will be responsible for delivering the outcome. To achieve this, the team will be expected to lead a Discovery process in Phase 1 (3 months), exploring and testing innovative ways of addressing barriers, understanding users needs and working through a range of questions which will need to be answered to ensure the feasibility of the project. The team will then project manage the development and the process of the technical build in Phase 2 through the Delivery phase (lasting approximately 12-14 months) informing the design of the solution. The discovery phase must be completed by January 2022 and the solution must be in place by March 2023.
