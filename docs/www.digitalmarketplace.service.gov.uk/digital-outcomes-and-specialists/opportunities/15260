          10. Regarding the first nice to have skills and experience; “Experience of working in highly regulated environments”, is it preferable to have GDS experience?
        </dt>
        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
          The experience provided should be in highly regulated environments and bidders do not have to demonstrate GDS specific experience.

          11. Regarding the 4th essential skills and experience; ‘Expertise of managing a large testing organisation; functional and non-functional testing functions; and managing large and complex testing activities and processes’, please clarify if this means, ‘providing testing services for a large organisation’ as opposed to ‘managing a large test organisation’?
        </dt>
        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
          This requirement will be both of these.  In order to effectively test the breadth of CFT requirements, there will be a requirement for a large test team.  CFT is implemented in a large complex organisation which has its own set of challenges.  Experience in a similar type of organisation will be required.
