          The Civil Service will respond better to the next crisis if we can rapidly identify and deploy individuals with the needed skills and experience to meet that crisis. An effective Civilian Reserve could increase the range of expertise and experience within government and improve its response to threats to national resilience.<br><br>The Civilian Reserves initiative is expected to have two strands:<br>Senior externals group. A group of senior leaders from the public, private, third sectors with expertise in matters relating to resilience and national security. Members of the group would offer their time to advise ministers and senior officials, and would be willing to use their organisations to facilitate government policy in times of crisis.<br><br>Civil Service Alumni Reserve. A network of experienced former crown and civil servants, who can be surged into critical crown and civil service roles or local resilience forums during a crisis, or be used to support a particular need where we might otherwise outsource to consultants.<br><br>The Civilian Reserve will need an effective digital service to effectively on-board, manage and deploy members of the Civilian Reserve if the scheme is going to meet the needs of the business.

          19. We understand you intend to down-select 5 suppliers to enter the ‘Assessment Stage’ based on the questions published on Digital Marketplace. We also understand that evaluation at Assessment Stage will be based on a written proposal and presentation. We assume that a full specification will be issued when successful suppliers are shortlisted (24th September) but can you confirm this and clarify what the likely submission deadline for the written proposal will be? We assume the deadline will be prior to supplier presentations (w/c 11th October) but it would be useful to have this confirmed so we can plan resource allocation

          Apologies for the confusion with the answer to question 14. To clarify, the contract is for both Discovery and Alpha. There will be up to 2 statements of work, the first covering Discovery and the second covering Alpha. This is required for Cabinet Office approval processes between the two stages. <br><br>The expectation is that the chosen supplier would deliver both phases if at the end of Discovery it was recommended and approved to continue to Alpha. However, we reserve the right to not use the second statement of work and re-tender at the end of Discovery phase if deemed appropriate.
