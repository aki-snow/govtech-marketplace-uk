          The current youth services web pages are very basic, providing a list of youth services and their locations along with events that take place at these locations: <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/childcare-and-parenting/activities-and-things-to-do/youth-clubs-in-southwark" class="govuk-link" rel="external">https://www.southwark.gov.uk/childcare-and-parenting/activities-and-things-to-do/youth-clubs-in-southwark</a><br><br>There is no option for users to register with the service, to receive notifications when events are taking place, or for external providers to list their services, facilities and events. We need a website which allows us to bring together comprehensive, up to date and accessible information about facilities, activities and services for young people and their families.<br><br>There should be a directory of all provision for young people in the borough which can easily be updated by council staff, youth providers and other organisations. The look and feel of the website should be appealing to young people aged 14-18. Users should be able to search for information using a simple keyword search or a more advanced search with different fields, including subject and geographical area. Users should be able to view results as a list or on a map which shows the locations of the services, activities or events.

        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
          As part of the extensive review of youth services in Southwark, engagement work with young people, parents/carers and professionals took place that asked questions around how they accessed information and what they would like to see in a youth services website. This discovery work has informed the requirements. <br><br>We would like to be able to present the alpha design and succeeding agile iterations of the new website to a panel of young people with their comments influencing the development and final version.  This will enable us to ensure user research and feedback is gained and utilised during the development phase, which is essential in ensuring the product meets the needs of our stakeholders. The Youth Services Manager will assemble the stakeholders who will provide their feedback at each stage, and will present the product to the group and then summarise the feedback and provide this to the supplier. <br><br>A cross council initiative is currently underway to create a ‘directories of service’ for residents which adheres to the open data referral standard (<a href="https://openreferraluk.org/Guidance/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">https://openreferraluk.org/Guidance/</a>) Any database element to this website should adhere to this standard so there is the possibility of integrating with the corporate directory of services when developed.

          It is expected that the successful agency will make at least one, potentially more, visits to our office at London Bridge or a designated youth centre in Southwark during the project. Equally, we are happy to be flexible, and visit the successful agency in person when needed. However, much of the work can be done remotely, with contact made through email, telephone, Zoom / Teams etc. Weekly catch up meetings during the initial design stage would be beneficial, with a minimum of annual account meetings once the website is live and we have moved to the maintenance stage.
