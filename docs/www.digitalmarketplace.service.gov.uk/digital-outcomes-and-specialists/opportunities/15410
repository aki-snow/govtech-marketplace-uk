          MOD must increase the pace at which new technologies are developed, explored and adopted for use so that we make best use of the opportunities that technological developments offer, and so that we do so at a pace that enables a perpetual technological edge over adversaries.  Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems are two critical and related technologies; consequently Defence has established an AI and Autonomous Systems Experimentation Hub to catalyse the integration and adoption of these critical and ubiquitous capabilities at near-development speed for enduring technological superiority.

          The Experimentation Hub will conduct rapid AI and AS concept development and experimentation.  Dstl requires an Agile delivery partner to  provide multi-disciplinary teams at various stages of the agile life-cycle to develop concepts to meet the needs of our users.  These teams will have experience and expertise in delivering AI-components of digital and physical systems.  We welcome bids from partnered suppliers who can collectively provide the required capabilities, including non-traditional defence suppliers.

          14. -	Could you reconsider the requirement around sponsorship? We were under the impression that the guidance for DOS5 framework is that suppliers should not be discriminated on the basis of having a pre-existing clearance as long as a supplier is willing to go through the process. The rule limits the supply to innovative non-traditional suppliers in an emerging field like AI where many companies are newer.
        </dt>
        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
          Suppliers who currently don&#39;t hold suitable clearances can bid on this requirement, however you must be willing to go through the process as clearance is essential to work on this contract.  There&#39;s an urgent need to process classified information up-to Secret upon contract commencement, we require the majority of supplier personnel to have relevant clearances by contract commencement.  As-per previously provided information, we welcome bids from partnered suppliers who can collectively provide the required capabilities, giving suppliers without current clearances the ability to partner with those that do.  During the contract, Dstl can sponsor clearances for individuals on a case-by-case-basis.

          Intelligent digital (virtual) systems is our term for any digital system using AI, in contrast to a physical system such as an autonomous vehicle. Examples would include systems to process intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data into actionable intelligence, a system to assess courses of action on military operations, or a system to optimise maintenance across a vehicle fleet to improve availability and reduce cost. Essentially a system whose output is better quality information – allowing Defence to make better decisions or to increase its efficiency - rather than a physical output.
