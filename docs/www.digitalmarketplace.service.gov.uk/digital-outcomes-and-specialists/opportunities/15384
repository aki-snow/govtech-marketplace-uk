          The NAO has committed to redeveloping the website as part of its 2020-25 strategy to: improve our support for effective public accountability; provide more accessible independent insight; and  increase our impact on outcomes and value for money.<br><br>To achieve these objectives we have set out three strategic enablers: (1) We will attract, retain and develop high quality people; (2) We will make more effective use of technology, data and knowledge; and (3) We aim to be an exemplar organisation. Within the second enabler we have committed to making our website easier to access the knowledge and insights from our work. However, we also need to ensure it is ‘exemplar’ both in terms of meeting user needs but also demonstrating value for money.<br><br>By the end of beta, we need an improved website for the NAO (a minimum viable product), which we may then continue to develop. The MVP needs to meet the needs of key users and to reflect the vision of the project, which is:<br>Our website makes our knowledge and insight accessible and impactful, while reinforcing our reputation as the UK’s independent public spending watchdog.

          Our discovery research showed that audiences find the current website hard to read, struggle to find content that is relevant, and aren’t clear what the NAO offer for them is.

We expect analysis and prototypes for validation through user research. Alpha must also explore ways to improve the technical architecture and development &amp; hosting model. In particular, one output of the alpha phase is a decision on whether (in beta) to do a full site rebuild and migration, or to improve the existing site. <br><br>Beta will build on the outcomes of alpha – implementing improvements to the technical architecture or site configuration, including those that support SEO and analytics. We expect “go-live” of some components or templates.

          3. Given the ambition for change and the wide scope of improvements needed when rebuilding, are you open to suppliers proposing a more suitable CMS platform? Your budget would comfortably cover a change of platform and migration, and we feel Drupal would give you a much more solid, secure foundation for the site, based on our experiences across organisations with similar scale and complexity. Your technical discovery indicates concern about Wordpress’s limitations including configuration management, and we would also raise concerns about its module/customisation approach and security.
