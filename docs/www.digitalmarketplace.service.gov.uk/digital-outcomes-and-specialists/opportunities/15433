          The FCDO is going through a demanding period of transformation following the merger between DFID and the FCO in September 2020. The organisation is merging Microsoft 365 tenants, introducing a new Oracle Finance and HR system, and consolidating technology services (authentication, devices, collaboration). <br><br>FCDO requires a Delivery Partner to provide additional capability and capacity to work in partnership with FCDO teams to support the department’s Digital and Data Transformation, delivering a wide range of digital and technology services to meet key outcomes.  This contract will enable FCDO to quickly flex up and down ensuring the right delivery capacity is available on demand to meet the scale of each deliverable/outcome, getting the right mix of skills on board for the duration needed.
