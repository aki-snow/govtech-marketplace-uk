          Sanctuary&#39;s Property Services portfolio launched its new vision and 5-year strategy in 2020. <br>Currently the portfolio operates across two operating models (responsive and planned works) and utilises multiple systems. <br>This model no longer meets the strategic vision for Property Services and therefore a digital solution is required to harmonise processes, remove manual administrative workload, improve data access, provide improved business continuity and enhance customer engagement. <br>One platform is required to cover both operating models, with both data capture out on site to drive the raising of works orders and data capture to confirm the work which has been done. <br>Please review the vision documents in the supplier pack, in particular:<br>document 5 - Property on a page;<br>document 6 - Property Services Canvas; and<br>document 8 - Critical Success Factors.

          Across half of the portfolio, operational processes are run on paper, Excel and Outlook. <br>The processes are very manually intensive, with numerous workarounds, which builds delay into the process for the end customer (tenants). <br>The data is managed in a piecemeal way and there is a risk of data falling through the gaps. <br>The other half of the portfolio operates on other applications.<br>The integration between these systems and SAP can be a cause for system downtime. <br>These systems don’t meet the requirements across the other half of the business. <br>The level of visibility of data for operatives out on site is very poor and hinders decision making, leading to further delays and handoffs across the process. <br>Customers have low visibility of the whereabouts of their request. <br>The process to raise a repair request from the Sanctuary website is clunky and, due to the freeform style, often results in failure demand, with a phone call required back to the tenant to clarify their request.<br>Please see the supplier pack for:<br>document 2 - High Level Business Requirements, <br>document 3 - High Level As Is with Pain Points<br>document 4 - High Level Capability Map with Dependencies.

They need to be able to capture data whilst out on site and for this data to integrate to SAP to both raise and confirm works orders. These teams also need to be able to see data from SAP and have a process in place to update data, to aid decisions and ensure data is as up to date as possible. <br>Sanctuary&#39;s planning teams need a tool which will enable them to ensure the right operatives with the right skills are sent to the right locations in the most efficient way possible, increasing productivity and ensuring a higher ratio of operatives to planners than we currently operate at.<br>Our customers (internal and external) need to be able to access our services quickly and efficiently, to raise requests via different routes and to have visibility of where that request is in process, to avoid them having to call in each time for an update.<br>Sanctuary&#39;s Property Services has 1800 operational staff. <br>Please see the supplier pack for <br>document 2 - High Level Business Requirements and<br>document 7 - FSM (New Proactive Operating Model).

          An MVP has been developed for FSM, across our Voids process in the NW region. <br>With this MVP, we have covered off raising works orders through the completion of a checklist onsite (using Z tables to map data to generate the operation lines within the works order via a transaction which has been internally developed). <br>Data is available from SAP on the app (e.g. asbestos surveys) and work is confirmed through SAP from the app, via the same internally developed transaction. <br>This work was completed with a third-party supplier. <br>Please see supplier pack for document 12 - High Level MVP.
