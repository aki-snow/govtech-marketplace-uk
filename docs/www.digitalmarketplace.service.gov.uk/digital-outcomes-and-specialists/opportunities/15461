          A major programme is underway in HMPPS to transform probation operations in England and Wales and this includes development of new digital services to support probation staff.  People will continue to use existing digital systems and services whilst development of new services is taking place and the cutover between old and new services needs to be as seamless as possible.  Data and functionality is being shared across services to allow this.  <br>Testing of the whole range of software changes needs to take place to ensure quality of new services delivered as well as integrity of existing systems which are critical to probation operations and public safety.  MOJ digital and technology has a very limited pool of testers and limited experience in developing a co-ordinated test approach for such a complex change programme.  We need access to expertise in testing best practice pan government with a focus on digital by default service delivery.

          Digital probation require a Managed Testing Service which will act as a supporting layer between in-house and 3rd party software development teams and service support and service management teams who are responsible for software release and for maintaining live services.  The testing service should provide test planning, test execution and test reporting on software changes for new and existing services with a particular focus on integration testing and non-functional testing of changes to National Delius. National Delius (Delius) is the Probation Service’s case management system and is crucial to the effective running of the probation service.<br>Due to the critical nature of the service, any changes, releases or updates need to be thoroughly end-to-end tested, including performance and other non-functional testing, before they can be deployed to live. These changes need to be tested against the interfaces that are in place and through the APIs that have been established. Some testing can be automated and scripts are continuously updated to do this but some of the regression and functionality testing needs to be done manually
