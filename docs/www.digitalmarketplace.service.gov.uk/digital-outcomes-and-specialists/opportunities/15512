          Since land is a finite resource, where and how it is used needs to be carefully considered to ensure competing priorities are taken into account and land is used in the most effective way possible. Simply put, this requires a joined-up approach to decisions about land use at national, regional, and local level. To ensure these decisions are based on evidence and stand up to public scrutiny, data about land is fundamentally important.<br><br>We will need to test the feasibility and value of an authoritative data platform as the single source for coherent data about land use in the UK. If scaled nationally, such a platform could enable joined up policy making and support the transition to low carbon uses of land while achieving other national priorities including housing development and improved biodiversity.<br><br>The work must be completed by February 2023.
