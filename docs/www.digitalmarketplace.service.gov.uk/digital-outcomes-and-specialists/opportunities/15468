          We want to increase employers use of expert work and health services, especially occupational health services, as this is associated with better outcomes for business and individuals.  <br>Specifically, we want to support employees with health conditions to thrive in work and prevent job loss associated with the poor management of health or disability events.<br>We need small &amp; medium employers (SMEs) and self-employed people to be aware of financial incentives to help them overcome cost barriers to accessing these services. We need to help small employers and self-employed people understand what expert health support can offer them, encourage and support them to buy appropriate services for their needs and reduce the need for costly &#39;search costs&#39;, and test the effectiveness of the targeted financial incentives that helps to reduce cost barriers to work. <br>This includes considering the role of providers as users in the purchasing process as we need providers to be aware that they could qualify to deliver subsidised services. <br>For context only 20% of employees working for SMEs have access to Occupational Health. There are approximately 1.5 million SMEs employing 17m people, and 4m self-employed people, in GB.

          DWP&#39;s Innovation Lab conducted rapid design work including small-scale user testing with small businesses validating our initial assumptions about government&#39;s trusted role in this space and unmet employer user needs in respect of information about expert health services.  This work confirmed financial barriers and the need for services to be tailored to a purchasing organisation&#39;s needs. There is a larger evidence base of formal research and evaluation (GB/International) describing the value of expert health advice in managing sickness and disability in the workplace, and the motivation of employers to generally do the right thing, but lacking knowledge, time and resources.
