          Our projections of the type of resources required for the work packages that are currently in scope are NHS Agenda for Change Roles at Bands 7, 8a and 8b.  In year one our projected architecture work packages will require (4) band 7, (7)  band 8a and (1) band 8b, a few roles will be for less than the full 12 months this may vary. <br><br>We are currently projecting a 25% reduction in year 2 and a further 50% reduction in year 3.<br><br>We would be interested in commercial models that give us savings and flexibility in financial and contractual terms.

          The NHSBSA is an Arm’s Length Body of the Department of Health and Social Care.  <br><br>We provide a platform for at scale, national payments for primary care services to dentists and pharmacists.  We support the NHS People Plan providing employment, HR and payroll platforms, as well as providing financial support to NHS students and managing the NHS Pension scheme.  We also provide a wide range of services direct to the public to help citizens in gaining access to the healthcare and support with costs to which they are entitled. <br><br>The NHSBSA technology environment has recently undergone significant change which has ended a long-term IT outsource contract with Capita bringing some services in house and establishing new contracts for others.<br><br>We have a mixed infrastructure estate with the majority of data and applications residing in the Crown Hosting data centres.  However, all new applications and services are being developed for cloud first and public cloud platforms.   <br><br>We have consolidated separate technology functions and built new teams.  Maturing these new teams by investing in both additional capacity, new capabilities and modern tooling is now a key feature of our strategy.

          The Architecture function within the BSA&#39;s Technology tower is seeking to complement its existing capability to enable rapid progress of a number of key delivery activities.  These activities will be delivered by either a work package describing the creation of a blended team, extending internal NHS BSA teams that need additional capacity; or via a full work package encompassing an independent delivery.  In the event of a blended team, the work package will describe skills, capabilities and outcomes and also facilitate knowledge transfer whilst we develop and grow capability from within.   A full work package will also describe working with the rest of the NHS BSA to ensure successful delivery, handover and knowledge transfer. <br><br>The deliverables will require work between Technology, Digital and Data to ensure that the architecture team can realise its ambitions whilst continuing to mature the function. <br><br>The NHS BSA DDaT functions support approximately 3000 staff, across multiple sites.
