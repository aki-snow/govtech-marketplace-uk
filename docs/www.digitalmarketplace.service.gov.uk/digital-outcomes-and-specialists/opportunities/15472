          Ofqual’s Digital, Data and Technology (DDAT) team continuously deliver a programme of strategic improvements in order to meet the organisations evolving needs as it continues to meet its Regulatory and Compliance responsibilities across Education in England.<br>Last year, Ofqual’s DDaT Programme Board agreed three key software development programmes for 2021 and 2022. These pieces of work are of significant strategic importance for Ofqual; their implementation will help deliver process efficiencies, improve cross-team communication, enable better case management and improve public accessibility and confidence in our services. <br>The in-house team have started work to establish the business processes, pain points and to define a set of minimum viable product (MVP) requirements for the prioritised outcomes, with the highest priorities to be delivered by April 2022.<br>Our key priority is to establish a highly collaborative, culturally aligned and value driven working relationship with an experienced strategic partner who is able that can immediately contribute as part of our existing Agile SCRUM delivery team. <br>Required expertise ranges from software development, test automation, data, design/analysis, and user experience research; but with potential for other disciplines as outcomes require. Desired mobilisation is anticipated to be no more than 4 weeks on each occasion; ideally faster.

          Users of our Portal system include internal Ofqual staff, regulated Awarding Organisations and the Northern Ireland regulator (CCEA Regulation). Data and statistic links are shared with a range of stakeholders, including the Welsh Regulator (Qualification Wales) and the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education. Regulated Awarding Organisations use the Portal to create and maintain their qualifications and units, submit event notifications and data to Ofqual, or to contact Ofqual or CCEA Regulator with queries.<br>The general public can access some of our public facing services including Complaints, Whistle-blowing and Malpractice (CWM) via our .gov webpage. Similar to other governmental organisations these public-facing services are developed in line with GDS standards. The public-facing CWM system integrates with our internal-facing Portal allowing Ofqual staff to manage cases and interactions with citizens in one place. <br>Prospective Awarding Organisations and prospective experts can respectively apply to Ofqual for recognition as an awarding organisation or an approved subject matter expert for Ofqual. They do this via our public-facing Gateway system also accessed via the .gov web page as well as being integrated into the Portal.

          The DDAT team sits within the Regulatory &amp; Corporate Services Directorate, managing several software products supporting business critical functions. <br><br>Ofqual’s regulatory IT system, the Portal, was first developed in-house in 2015. It manages interactions with regulated awarding organisations, enabling them to manage qualifications and units data; also to notify Ofqual of any events that may cause adverse effects to learners. <br><br>Using Agile SCRUM methodologies, the DDAT team deliver against programme priorities set by the DDAT Programme Board. We are currently on a journey to improve our delivery cadence through the adoption of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices.
